They approach the cobweb and a villain called Fax jumps down from a tree infront of them with his pet 
Spidey. Fix and Crabby looks at each other thinking they have to kill the villain and his pet fast so they can help Crablisa. 
They start to attack Fax and Spidey. Spidey goes in a frenzy and charges like lightning, screaming out a warcry loud as thunder.
Crabby uses his claw and cuts Spideys legs of and Spidey dies... 
Fix takes out a spellbook out of his backpack and uses a fire spell to burn the cobweb and Fax at the same time, Fax died...

The wizard Fix and his side-kick Crabby won the battle and continued to run towards Crablisa.
